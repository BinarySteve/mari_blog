              of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this
              Privacy Policy. This Site strives to offer its visitors the many
              advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive
              and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
              Information (your name, e-mail address and/or your contact
              details) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.

              We may collect and store personal or other information that you
              voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while
              on the Site, submitting a form or in responding via email to a
              feature provided on the Site). This Site only contacts individuals
              who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they
              have signed up to receive our free newsletters or submitted a

              We also collect and store information that is generated
              automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For
              example, we may collect information about your computer’s
              connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things,
              to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure
              traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in
              browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with
              the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on
              your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and
              when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver
              advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track

              We may also make some content, products and services available
              through our Site through cooperative relationships with
              third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner
              appear on the Site in connection with such content, products
              and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any
              information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of
              visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our
              provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect
              information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy
              of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of
              your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may
              differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy
              policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the
              provider partner directly for more information.
